# Bootstrap

## Empirical Distribution Function

The empirical distribution function is designed to estimate a random variable's distribution function. For an observed sample $\{x_i\}^n_{i=1}$, the empirical distribution function is

$$
F_n(x) \left\{\begin{array}{cc}
0, & x < x_{(1)} \\
\frac{i}{n},& x_{(i)} \leq x <x_{(i+1)},\ i = 1,\ldots,n-1\\
1,& x_{(n)}\leq x
\end{array}
\right.
$$

where $x_{(1)}, \ldots, x_{(n)}$ are the ordered sample.

## Sampling an unknown $F$

The idea behind bootstrapping is that the data comes from a distribution $F$ with unknown parameters.

Using the sample, we can get parameters that explain a parameteric distribution or the emperical distribution for a nonparameteric approach. 

## The Bootstrap Method

The Bootstrap Method utilizes the sample to describe the target distribution function to construct a sampling mechanism of the target distribution.

This method will allow us to construct a new sample that targets the distribution.

We can then construct the sampling distribution of a statistic based on the data.

## Standard Error

The bootstrap-based standard error of a test statistic is shown to provide an unbiased estimate of the true standard error. 

## Limitation to Boostrap Methods

The assumption is that the data provides a good estimate of the distribution function.

If the data set is small, it may not contain enough information to accurately describe the distribution.

## Limitation Example

# Parameteric Bootstrap

## Parameteric Bootstrap

Parametric bootstrap methods are statistical techniques used to estimate the sampling distribution of an estimator or test statistic by resampling with a model-based approach. This method assumes that the data follow a known probability distribution, and utilizes the estimated statistics as the parameters for the distribution function to construct the sampling distribution.

## Parameteric Bootstrap Algorithm

1. Estimate the Parameters: Fit a parametric model to the observed data and estimate the parameters of the model. 

2. Generate Bootstrap Samples: Using the estimated parameters, generate a large number of new data sets (bootstrap samples) from the fitted model. These samples are simulated data sets that mimic the original data but are generated from the parametric model.

3. Compute the Statistic of Interest: For each bootstrap sample, calculate the statistic of interest (e.g., the mean, variance, regression coefficients, etc.).

4. Construct the Sampling Distribution: Use the calculated statistics from all the bootstrap samples to construct an empirical sampling distribution. 

5. Estimate Confidence Intervals: Use the empirical sampling distribution to estimate confidence intervals.

## Example

Use a parameteric bootstrap model to determine the standard errors of the mean body mass of each penguin species.

```{r}
penguins |> group_by(species) |> 
  summarise(mean = mean(body_mass_g),
            se = sd(body_mass_g) / sqrt(n()))
```

Answer:

```{r}
means <- penguins$body_mass_g |> tapply(penguins$species, mean)
nns <- penguins$body_mass_g |> tapply(penguins$species, length)
sds <- penguins$body_mass_g |> tapply(penguins$species, sd)
Ameans <- numeric(10000)
Cmeans <- numeric(10000)
Gmeans <- numeric(10000)
for (i in 1:10000){
  Ameans[i] <- rnorm(nns[1], mean = means[1], sd = sds[1]) |> mean()
  Cmeans[i] <- rnorm(nns[2], mean = means[2], sd = sds[2]) |> mean()
  Gmeans[i] <- rnorm(nns[3], mean = means[3], sd = sds[3]) |> mean()
}


```


# Nonparameteric Bootstrap

## Nonparameteric Bootsrap

The nonparameteric approach assumes that distribution function of the data does not follow a common distribution function. Therefore, the data itself will be contain all the information needed to construct the sampling distribution.

This requires sampling with replacement.

## Nonparameteric Bootstrap Algorithm

1.  Draw a sample $X*$ of size $n$ with replacement from the original data $X$.
    1.  $n$ is the size of the data
2.  Compute the bootstrap replicate statistic $T* = g(X*)$, where $g(\cdot)$ is the function that computes the statistic of interest.
3.  Repeat steps 1-2 $B$ times to obtain $B$ bootstrap replicates ${T*_1, T*_2, ..., T*_B}$.
4.  The computed statistics from $B$ samples are the empirical bootstrap distribution of the statistic, $g(X)$.
5.  Calculate the bootstrap standard error of the statistic, $se_b(g(X))$, as the standard deviation of the bootstrap replicates.
6.  Calculate the bootstrap confidence interval for the statistic, $CI(g(X))$, with the $\alpha$ and $(1-\alpha)%$ percentiles of the bootstrap replicates, where $\alpha$ is the desired level of significance.

## Example

Fitting the following model:

```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
library(tidyverse)
penguins <- penguins |> drop_na()
penguins |> lm(body_mass_g ~ flipper_length_mm + bill_length_mm + bill_depth_mm,
               data = _)
```

Obtain the Bootstrap-based Standard Errors for the regression coefficients. Use $B=1000$ bootstrap samples.
